This is a program for questioning students and other people. 
The program has a graphical interface with questions, answer options with choice marks, a field for entering your own answer, and buttons "Select an answer option" and "Select your own answer". 
The interface will change questions after participants answer. 
There is also an auxiliary file "Questions" from which the program takes questions for the questionnaire. Its functionality:
1) Selecting an answer option by clicking on the desired selection label and confirming this action by clicking the "Select Answer" button.
2) Choosing your answer by writing text in the input field and confirming this action by pressing the "Choose your answer" button.
The program will write all the selected answers to the file "Answers of participant №", where № is the number in order of passing the questionnaire, when the participant of the survey answers the last question. 
The file "Number of respondents" stores information about the number of people who completed the questionnaire.
